/// Partner and global values reach a mapper by being written <em>into</em> the incoming document as

/// more than it looks: the payload has to be parsed as JSON before anything knows which mapper is
/// configured, so a non-JSON document cannot get that far; any document with a real key of the same
/// name loses it; and only a JSON object is enriched, so the same mapping behaves differently for a
/// root array.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A mapper marked this way is handed the values separately and the payload is left exactly as it
/// arrived — which is the only way a format other than JSON can be mapped at all.
