## Sign-in

Bitween supports three ways to sign in.

### Email and password

`POST /api/accounts/login` with `{ "Username": "...", "Password": "..." }`.

- Five wrong passwords in a row lock the account for 15 minutes. An administrator can unlock it early.
- Disabled accounts cannot sign in.
- Passwords need at least 8 characters, including an upper-case letter, a lower-case letter, a digit and a symbol. When an administrator sets someone else's password, only the 8-character minimum applies.
- Passwords are hashed with PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256, 210,000 iterations and a random salt, and compared in constant time. Hashes stored before September 2026 use PBKDF2-SHA1 with 10,000 iterations. They still verify, and are only replaced when the password is next set.
- Bitween sends no email, so there is no self-service password reset.

Turning on the **Microsoft sign-in only** setting disables this method. New accounts are then created without a password.

### Microsoft

The sign-in page offers Microsoft once the Azure AD client id, tenant id and redirect URI settings are all set.

1. The browser signs in through an MSAL popup and gets an ID token.
2. It posts `{ "MsToken": "<id token>" }` to `POST /api/accounts/login`.
3. Bitween validates the token's signature and lifetime against Microsoft's published signing keys, reads the email, and signs in the Bitween account with that email.

Accounts are never created automatically. Add each person on the Team page first.

The redirect URI must be `/blank.html` on the Bitween host, such as `https://bitween.example.com/blank.html`, and must be registered on the Azure AD app. Other pages send a cross-origin opener policy that breaks the popup. Bitween logs a warning at startup when the redirect URI does not end in `/blank.html`.

Bitween does not check the token's issuer or audience. See [Known limitations](caveats.md#security).

### Break-glass login

`POST /api/login` with `{ "Username": "...", "Password": "..." }` compares the values with `Bitween:AdminCredentials`, written as `user:password`. A match returns a token with every permission, without touching the database, and there is no lockout.

The default in code is `admin:1234512345`. **Override `Bitween__AdminCredentials` in every environment.**

## Tokens and sessions

- Sign-in returns `{ "jwt": "..." }`. Send it as `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`.
- The JWT is signed with `Token:Key` and carries `Token:Issuer` and `Token:Audience`. It lasts for the **Sign-in session length** setting, 60 minutes by default.
- Sign-in also sets a `refresh_token` cookie that is `HttpOnly`, `Secure` and `SameSite=Lax`, valid for 30 days. Posting to the login endpoint with that cookie and no credentials returns a new JWT and replaces the refresh token.
- `POST /api/accounts/logout` deletes the refresh token and tells the browser to clear site data. The JWT stays valid until it expires.
- The admin UI signs out after 30 minutes without activity in any tab.
- Permissions are not in the token. They are read from the database on every request, so removing a role takes effect at once.

## Roles and permissions

A permission is written `area.action`. A member holds the union of their roles' permissions.

| Group | Area | Actions |
|---|---|---|
| Operate | `exchanges` | view, operate |
| Operate | `monitoring` | view |
| Operate | `dashboard` | view |
| Subscriptions | `subscriptions` | view, create, edit, delete, operate |
| Subscriptions | `partners` | view, create, edit, delete |
| Subscriptions | `documents` | view, create, edit, delete |
| Subscriptions | `global-values` | view, create, edit, delete |
| Subscriptions | `notifiers` | view, create, edit, delete |
| Subscriptions | `api-gateways` | view, create, edit, delete |
| Subscriptions | `bus-gateways` | view, create, edit, delete |
| Configuration | `data-sources` | view, create, edit, delete, operate |
| Configuration | `data-source-statements` | view, create, edit, delete |
| Configuration | `workgroups` | view, create, edit, delete |
| Configuration | `retry-policies` | view, create, edit, delete |
| Administration | `users` | view, create, edit, delete |
| Administration | `roles` | view, create, edit, delete |
| Administration | `settings` | view, edit |
| Administration | `audit` | view |

- `exchanges.operate` covers retrying and resubmitting exchanges, including running a scheduled retry now.
- `subscriptions.operate` covers pause, resume, receive now, roll up now and resetting a retry budget.
- `data-sources.operate` covers testing a connection. `data-source-statements` lets people write SQL for a database without the right to change its credentials.
- `documents` is the information types area.
- The audit trail has only `view`, because nothing can change it.

### Built-in roles

| Role | Permissions |
|---|---|
| Administrator | Every permission, including ones added in later versions |
| Member | Every action in the Operate, Subscriptions and Configuration groups |
| Viewer | Only the view actions in those groups |

Built-in roles cannot be edited or deleted. Custom roles can hold any combination, and cannot be deleted while members hold them.

Bitween refuses to remove, disable or demote the last enabled Administrator. Members cannot disable or remove themselves.

A request without the needed permission gets HTTP 401, the same status as a missing sign-in.

`GET /api/permissions` returns the full catalogue with labels and descriptions. `GET /api/accounts/profile` returns the signed-in member's permissions.

## Partners and API keys

Partners authenticate with an API key sent in the `partnerkey` header. API gateways and the legacy exchange endpoints use it.

- Generate a key on the partner page. It is shown once. Afterwards the API returns only its first five characters.
- Keys must be unique and are stored in plain text.
- Removing a key revokes it immediately.

The seeded **SYSTEM** partner has a key named `default` whose value is fixed in the source code. That key can post documents of any information type to `POST /api/xchanges/{informationType}`, which feeds the filter. **Replace or remove the SYSTEM partner's key on every instance.**

## Secrets

- Adapter properties marked secret are masked as `__private__` in every API response and redacted from the audit trail.
- The Rebex license key is the only secret setting. It is encrypted with AES-256-GCM, using a key derived from `Bitween:SettingsEncryptionKey`. Without that passphrase the value can only come from configuration, and changing the passphrase makes the stored value unreadable.
- Partner properties, global values, adapter properties and data source settings, including passwords, are stored unencrypted in the database.

## Exchange files

Exchange files are uploaded as public objects unless the **Keep exchange files private** setting is on. `GET /api/bitweendocs?documentKey=...`, which the UI uses to show file content, needs no sign-in and returns the content of any storage key it is given.

## Data sources

Data sources open connections to customers' brokers and databases, so they only run on nodes with `Bitween__BusProvidersEnabled` set.

- Their settings are masked in responses but stored unencrypted.
- Anyone with `data-sources.view` can browse a database's catalogue and see the login's privileges.
- Saving or testing an Oracle statement runs `DBMS_SQL.PARSE`, which executes DDL. Connect Oracle sources with a login that has no DDL rights.
- SQL only comes from named statements, and every value is bound as a parameter, unless a data source turns on `AllowAdHocSql`.

## HTTP hardening

Every response carries these headers.

| Header | Value |
|---|---|
| `X-Frame-Options` | `DENY` |
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | `nosniff` |
| `Referrer-Policy` | `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` |
| `X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies` | `none` |
| `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` | `same-origin-allow-popups`, or `unsafe-none` on `/blank.html` so the Microsoft popup works |
| `Content-Security-Policy` | Scripts from the same origin only, inline styles allowed, Microsoft sign-in allowed for connections, frames and forms, and no framing by other sites. Not sent under `/swagger`. |

- JSON responses carry `Cache-Control: no-store`. Hashed UI assets are cached for a year, and `index.html` is always revalidated.
- CORS is closed unless `Bitween:CorsOrigins` lists origins, which are then allowed with credentials.
- Request bodies are limited to 50 MB.
- Responses are gzip-compressed, including over HTTPS.

## Audit trail

Bitween records every change to configuration: subscriptions and their schedules, categories, partners and API keys, information types, gateways and routes, work groups, retry policies and alert overrides, notifiers, global value sets, settings, accounts, roles and role assignments.

Each entry holds the time, the member, the entity and its key, whether it was added, modified or deleted, and the old and new value of each changed property. Entries from one save share a correlation id. Adapter properties, partner properties, global values, API key values, passwords and secret settings are redacted. Exchanges and other runtime records are not audited.

The trail is written in the same transaction as the change, and no API edits or deletes it. Browse it on the Audit trail page or with `GET /api/audit`.

## Production checklist

1. Set `Bitween__AdminCredentials` to an unguessable user name and password.
2. Change the seeded administrator's password, or add your own administrator and then remove the seeded one.
3. Replace or remove the SYSTEM partner's API key.
4. Set `Token__Key` to a long random secret, and choose your own `Token__Issuer` and `Token__Audience`.
5. Set `Bitween__SettingsEncryptionKey` before saving a Rebex license key.
6. Turn on **Keep exchange files private** when payloads are sensitive, and block `/api/bitweendocs` at the edge if members' browsers are the only intended readers.
7. Serve Bitween over HTTPS. The refresh cookie is always marked `Secure`.
8. Connect data sources with least-privilege logins, and never with DDL rights on Oracle.
9. Review [Known limitations](caveats.md#security).
