# Entry points

Every exchange starts at one of these entry points, and all of them lead into the same [pipeline](exchange-pipeline.md).

| Entry point | Subscription type | Runs the validator | Honours pause |
|---|---|---|---|
| API gateway | `GatewayApiCall` | Yes | No |
| Bus gateway route | `BusGateway` | No | Yes |
| Bus message to an internal subscription | `Internal` | No | Yes |
| Scheduled job | `Receiving` | No | No |
| Aggregation | `Aggregation` | No | No |
| Legacy API call | `ApiCall` | Yes | No |
| Exchange created by hand | Any | No | No |

## API gateways

An API gateway gives partners one HTTP endpoint. Each attached partner is paired with the API gateway subscription that runs when that partner calls, so two partners can call the same URL and run different pipelines.

### Setting one up

1. Create the gateway with a name and a URL name. The URL name must be lowercase letters and digits, optionally separated by single `-` or `_` characters.
2. Attach a partner, and pick or create an API gateway subscription for it.
3. Give the partner an API key on its partner page.
4. Activate the subscription.

### Calling a gateway

```bash
curl -X POST "https://bitween.example.com/api/gateway/orders/async" \
  -H "partnerkey: <partner API key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"order": {"id": "SO-1001"}}'
```

The body is read as text and stored as the input file, named `{urlName}.json`. The exchange gets the reference `partnerkey: <key name>`.

Bitween checks each call in this order.

| Check | Response when it fails |
|---|---|
| A gateway with this URL name exists | 404 |
| The `partnerkey` header matches a partner's API key | 401 |
| That partner is attached to this gateway | 401 |
| The gateway is active | 503, saying the gateway is deactivated |
| The attached subscription is active | 404 |
| The subscription's validator accepts the body | Validation error |

Deactivation is checked after authorization on purpose, so only attached partners learn that the gateway exists.

### Async and sync

`/async` returns `202 Accepted` with the exchange id as soon as the exchange is stored.

`/sync` waits for the result and then responds as follows.

| Outcome | Response |
|---|---|
| Success with no response body | `200` with the exchange id |
| Success with a response | `200` with the response body and its content type |
| Bad response | `400` with the response body |
| Failure | `400` with no body |
| Wait ended before a result | `202` with the exchange id |

The `Wait-Period` header is meant to limit the wait. Bitween checks for the result after 1, 1, 2, 3 and 5 seconds, then every 8 seconds. The loop compares the current step, not the elapsed time, with the header value. Since the step never exceeds 8 seconds, a `Wait-Period` of 8 or more keeps the request open until the exchange has a result. That includes the default of 120. Only values below 8 can end with a `202`. Always set a timeout on the client or proxy.

## Bus gateways

A bus gateway receives documents published to Bitween's internal RabbitMQ bus, or read from a queue on a customer's own RabbitMQ or Amazon SQS broker. This section covers the internal bus. For a customer's broker, see [External brokers](external-brokers.md); routes behave the same way.

### Setting one up

1. On the information type, turn on **Available on the message bus** and set the **bus message type name**. Every instance starts consuming that message type.
2. Create a bus gateway for the information type. Its information type cannot be changed later.
3. Add routes. Each route has:
   - an optional **match expression** over the payload, where none means every message matches;
   - an optional **partner**, whose properties fill `{{partner.KEY}}` tokens;
   - a **bus gateway subscription** of the same information type to run.

Every matching route runs, so one message can start several pipelines. Deactivating a gateway stops its routes from matching without deleting them.

### Publishing a message

Publish the raw document as the message body under the bus message type name through the SimplyWorks bus, for example with `IPublish.Publish("order-created", json)` from another SimplyWorks service. The bus request context's correlation id becomes the exchange's correlation id.

### What happens to the message

The message becomes a document-level exchange. The filter then creates one exchange per matching route and per matching internal subscription. When the information type has **Disregard unfiltered messages** on, the filter runs straight away instead, and only the matching exchanges are stored.

### Chaining

Setting a subscription's response message type name publishes its handler's response to the bus. When that name belongs to a bus-enabled information type, the response arrives as a new document that bus gateway routes can pick up. The Flow map page draws these chains and flags loops.

## Scheduled jobs

A scheduled job, a `Receiving` subscription, pulls data with a receiver adapter on a schedule. To poll a database, see [Databases](databases.md#receiving-rows). Each run does the following.

1. Skips the run if the job is already running on any instance.
2. Moves the next run time forward, whatever happens next.
3. Starts the receiver with its properties, after resolving `{{globals...}}` tokens. Partner tokens are not resolved for receivers.
4. Lists the available items. For each item it reads the item, creates an exchange, then deletes or moves the item at the source.
5. Records a receive attempt: *Received*, *No new data* or *Failed*, with the ids of the exchanges created.
6. Resets or increments the subscription's consecutive failure count.

If one item fails, the run stops and is recorded as failed, together with the exchanges it had already created. An item is deleted only after its exchange exists, so a failure never loses an item. An item can be received twice if deleting it at the source fails.

**Receive now** runs the job once, immediately, without changing its schedule. See [Scheduling](scheduling.md) for schedules, run history and schedule health.

## Aggregations

An aggregation rolls finished exchanges of one subscription into a single exchange on a schedule. See [Aggregation](exchange-pipeline.md#aggregation). **Roll up now** runs it immediately.

## Internal subscriptions (legacy)

An internal subscription runs for every document of its information type whose payload passes its match expression. Documents reach it from the bus, from the SYSTEM partner posting to the legacy endpoint, or from an exchange created by hand for an information type. The UI marks this type as legacy. Bus gateways do the same job and add routes, partners and deactivation.

## API call subscriptions (legacy)

The original partner endpoint accepts a document for an information type and runs the calling partner's API call subscription for it.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://bitween.example.com/api/xchanges/purchase-order" \
  -H "partnerkey: <partner API key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "waitresponse: 30" \
  -d '{"order": {"id": "SO-1001"}}'
```

- The last path segment is the information type's id or name.
- The body must be a JSON object. Bitween adds the request's context values to it as a `_ExternalRequestContext` string field before storing it.
- The partner may have at most one subscription for the information type.
- When the key belongs to the SYSTEM partner and no subscription exists, the document goes to the filter as if it had arrived on the bus.

Without a `waitresponse` header, the call returns `200` with the exchange id at once. With one, it waits using the same checking loop as a sync gateway, with the same caveat about long waits.

| Outcome | Response |
|---|---|
| Success with no response body | `200` when the **Accepted response status code** setting is 200, otherwise `202` |
| Success with a response | `200` with the response body, its content type, and a `location` header holding the exchange id |
| Bad response | An error status with the response body |
| Failure | A validation error, *Internal processing error.* |
| Wait ended | `202` with the exchange id |

The partner can read the outcome later with `GET /api/xchanges/{exchangeId}`, which returns whether it succeeded and a URL to the response file.

## Exchanges created by hand

In the admin UI, members with `exchanges.operate` can create an exchange from the Exchanges page. The API equivalent is `POST /api/xchanges`.

```json
{ "option": "SubscriberId", "subscriberId": 42, "data": "{\"order\":{\"id\":\"SO-1001\"}}" }
```

With `"option": "DocumentId"` and a `documentId`, the payload becomes a document-level exchange and fans out through the filter. The input file is named `manual.json`.
