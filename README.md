# Bitween

Bitween is a self-hosted integration platform. It takes business documents in from partners, HTTP calls, message brokers, databases and scheduled pulls. It validates, transforms and delivers them, and keeps a searchable record of every exchange.

One .NET 10 service hosts everything: the REST API, the partner-facing gateway endpoints, background processing, the scheduler and the React admin UI.

> These docs are written from the source code as of 11 September 2026. They replace the earlier README and `docs/` pages, which described an older version of Bitween.

## What Bitween does

- **Many ways in.** Partners call an API gateway. Other systems publish to Bitween's bus, or to their own RabbitMQ or Amazon SQS broker. Scheduled jobs pull from HTTP APIs, S3, Azure Blob, SFTP/FTP, POP3 mailboxes and databases. Aggregations roll finished exchanges up on a schedule.
- **One pipeline.** Every message becomes an *exchange* that runs through the same stages: filter, map, deliver, route the response.
- **Adapters for each stage.** Built-in adapters cover HTTP, S3, Azure Blob, SFTP/FTP, POP3 and SMTP, plus a visual rules-based mapper for JSON and XML. Anything else can be a custom adapter that runs out of process.
- **Long-lived connections.** Data sources hold connections to RabbitMQ and Amazon SQS brokers and to PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server and Oracle databases, so deliveries can publish messages or run SQL.
- **Reliability built in.** Retry policies match failures and retry them with a delay and a shared budget. Every exchange's retries form a chain you can follow. Exhausted budgets raise alerts, and notifiers report results.
- **Operable.** Queue health straight from RabbitMQ, data source health, schedule health, run history, receive attempts, a dashboard and an audit trail of every configuration change.
- **Administered in the browser.** Roles with fine-grained permissions, Microsoft sign-in, and settings and branding that change at runtime.

## Requirements

| Component | Supported |
|---|---|
| Build | .NET 10 SDK, Node 22 with Yarn for the admin UI |
| Database | PostgreSQL, SQL Server or MySQL 8 |
| Message broker | RabbitMQ, with the management plugin for queue health |
| Object storage | S3-compatible, Azure Blob Storage, Oracle Cloud Object Storage, or local disk in Development |

## Quick start

This runs Bitween locally against PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ and local-disk storage.

1. Start the dependencies.

   ```bash
   docker run -d --name bitween-pg -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres postgres:16
   docker run -d --name bitween-mq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:3-management
   ```

2. Build the admin UI into the web host's `wwwroot`.

   ```bash
   cd SW.Bitween.Web/ClientApp
   yarn install
   yarn build
   cd ../..
   ```

3. Configure and run the service.

   ```bash
   export ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
   export Bitween__DatabaseType=PgSql
   export ConnectionStrings__BitweenDb="Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=bitween;Username=postgres;Password=postgres"
   export ConnectionStrings__RabbitMQ="amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/"
   export Bitween__StorageProvider=Local
   export CloudFiles__BucketName=bitween
   export Token__Key="replace-with-a-random-string-of-at-least-32-chars"
   export Token__Issuer=bitween-local
   export Token__Audience=bitween-local
   export Bitween__RabbitMqManagementUrl=http://localhost:15672
   export Bitween__RabbitMqManagementUsername=guest
   export Bitween__RabbitMqManagementPassword=guest

   dotnet run --project SW.Bitween.Web
   ```

4. Open https://localhost:5000 and sign in as the seeded administrator.

   ```
   admin@Bitween.systems
   Mtm@dmin!2
   ```

The database schema is created on first start. Change the administrator password straight away, and work through the [production checklist](docs/security.md#production-checklist) before exposing an instance. To use brokers or databases as data sources, see [Data sources](docs/data-sources.md#turning-them-on).
