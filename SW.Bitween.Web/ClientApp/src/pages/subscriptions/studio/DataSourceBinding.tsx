/**
 * Binds an adapter slot to a database: which connection, which statement, and what to do with it.
 *
 * Shown only when the slot's adapter is a relational data source provider, because for anything
 * else there is nothing here to choose. It writes two things, in two places, and the split is the
 * point:
 *
 * - The CONNECTION is the subscription's (`dataSourceId`). One per subscription — several slots
 *   pointed at the same database share one warm pool, which is the whole reason the pool is held
 *   by a long-lived process.
 * - The STATEMENT and OPERATION are this SLOT's adapter properties, so a subscription's handler
 *   and its receiver can run different statements through the same connection.
 *
 * What it never offers is a box to type SQL into. Adapter property values have `{{partner.X}}`
 * substituted into them before the adapter sees them, so SQL here would be steerable by ordinary
 * partner data. The statement is a name; the SQL lives on the data source, under its own permission.
