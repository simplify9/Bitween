 * The detail endpoint is polled so the connection panel stays live, and every poll brings a fresh
 * heartbeat time, state and failure count. Re-seeding the form from each of those responses threw
 * away whatever was being typed — a setting added and not yet saved vanished within ten seconds,
 * with no error and nothing to suggest the form had done it.
 *
 * Comparing this instead means a poll that changed only the live figures leaves the form alone,
 * while a genuine change to the settings — a save, which re-masks the secrets, or another node's
 * edit — still re-seeds it.
