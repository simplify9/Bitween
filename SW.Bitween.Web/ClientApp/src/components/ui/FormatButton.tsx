/**
 * Lays out the JSON or XML in a box someone types into.
 *
 * A button rather than the Raw/Formatted toggle the exchange drawer has, because that
 * one shows a document nobody can edit. Here the text belongs to whoever typed it, so
 * reflowing it is something they do rather than a way of looking at it. Integrations
 * hand out samples as one long line, and XML arrives that way almost every time.
 *
 * It cannot be undone — a programmatic change is not on the textarea's own undo stack,
 * and a sample is deliberately not on the editor's. That is tolerable only because
 * `formatDocument` adds whitespace and nothing else: the document afterwards is the
 * same document, so the most anyone loses is a layout they arranged by hand.
 *
 * Absent when there is nothing to gain: while the text is half-typed and unparseable,
 * and again once it is already laid out. That is `formatDocument`'s own answer, so the
 * button is never offered for a document it would refuse or leave alone.
