// ─── Building rules from a sample of the output document ──────────────────────
//
// The old editor had this as "Generate from JSON": it flattened the target into
// strings like `lines[*].sku`, replaced every mapping it already had, swallowed a
// parse error with an empty catch, and left all of them unassigned.
//
// This one creates a real list for each list, reads each field's type off the
// sample, fills in the source fields it can identify, and only ever adds — on a
// document with two hundred fields the structure was never the slow part.
//
// The sample seeds the rules and is then only a note for the next reader. It is
// not the definition of the output: the rules are, which is why deleting the
// sample cannot change what the mapping produces.
