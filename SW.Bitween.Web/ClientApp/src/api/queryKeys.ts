/**
 * Every cache label in the app, in one place.
 *
 * Keys are hierarchical and grouped by *entity*, not by endpoint: a subscription's detail, its
 * paged rows and the whole-list cache all start with `["subscriptions"]`. React Query matches
 * invalidation by prefix, so `invalidateQueries({ queryKey: keys.subscriptions.all })` clears the
 * lot — one line where the old hand-written string keys needed one line per variant, and where
 * missing one was silent.
 *
 * It was not hypothetical: nothing in the app ever invalidated `partners-search`,
 * `information-types-search`, `retry-policies-search` or `api-gateways-search` — the four paged
 * tables people actually look at. They only appeared correct because the global 10s staleTime
 * expired almost immediately and a remount refetched. Two more pairs (`information-types` /
 * `information-types-all`, `partners` / `partners-all`) were the same fetch cached twice under
 * different names, and `appConfig` / `app-config` were one endpoint under two labels, only one of
 * which the settings page invalidated.
 *
 * Adding a query? Add its key here. A new key under an existing entity is covered by that
 * entity's existing invalidations automatically, which is the whole point.
