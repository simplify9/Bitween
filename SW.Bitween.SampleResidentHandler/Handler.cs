/// A handler that STAYS RUNNING, used exactly where a classic one would be — as a subscription's

/// It implements IInfolinkHandler like any other, so nothing about the pipeline's contract changes.
/// What differs is that the process is started once and kept, which is what a real one would use to
/// hold an open connection or a warm cache instead of paying for them on every message.
///
/// It counts what it has handled and reports that on the heartbeat, so a test can prove the SAME
/// process served more than one message — which is the whole distinction from the classic
/// lifecycle, and not something a single call could show.
