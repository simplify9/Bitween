/// <summary>
/// One named piece of SQL a data source is allowed to run.
///
/// This is deliberately an entity rather than a JSON blob on <see cref="DataSource"/>, and the
/// reason is permissions before anything else. Statements have to live on the connection — the
/// alternative, SQL in a subscription's adapter properties, is a live injection surface, because
/// those property values have <c>{{partner.X}}</c> substituted into them before the adapter ever
/// sees them, and partner records are ordinary data. But putting the SQL in a field on the data
/// source meant that adding a statement required the same right as changing the credentials, so
/// anyone configuring their own integration needed power over the connection.
///
/// Separating it fixes three more things that were only going to get worse:
///
/// * <b>Contention.</b> One blob shared by every subscription on that database is two teams editing
///   one field, where a bad edit fails the connection test for everyone.
/// * <b>Namespacing.</b> A unique index on (data source, name) makes a collision an error at the
///   point of saving rather than a silent overwrite.
/// * <b>Dead SQL.</b> A statement nothing references is now a countable fact — see the usage
///   endpoint — instead of a line nobody dares delete.
///
/// What does NOT change is the adapter contract. The supervisor composes these rows into the same
/// <c>Statements</c> JSON the adapter has always received, so an adapter still resolves a name and
/// knows nothing about where the SQL was kept.
