/// <para>
/// Both halves share the <c>(SubscriptionId, GroupId)</c> key, so they are reported together — the
/// question worth asking about an exhausted budget is whether anyone was told about it, and
/// splitting that across two reports leaves the caller to join them by eye.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Starts from the policy's groups rather than from the stored counters, so a subscription that has
/// never failed still gets a row and its alert override stays configurable before the first failure.
/// Counters for groups no longer in the policy are therefore left out, which is what
/// <see cref="Update"/> and <see cref="Delete"/> delete outright.
/// </para>
