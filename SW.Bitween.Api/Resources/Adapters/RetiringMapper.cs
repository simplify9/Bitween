/// This is how the old mapper retires. A subscription already using it is untouched — it keeps

/// finishes, rather than when someone remembers to delete the adapter.

/// One-way on purpose: past that point there is no picking it again. Which is why the question of
/// what counts as "in use" is answered generously — an inactive subscription still holds its
/// template and can be switched back on, so it counts. Withholding a mapper a subscription is
/// still saved with would leave that subscription's own mapper missing from the list its picker
/// draws from, which reads as no mapper chosen at all.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The same idea already exists a level down: <see cref="NativeAdapterDiscoveryService"/> withholds
/// the Rebex-backed adapters while no license key is set, so that a picker never offers something
/// that could only fail. This withholds one that would only lengthen a migration.
