/// The alternative is what we had: store anything, and find out at the connection test — or, if

/// earlier by someone else. A typo belongs to whoever typed it, and the only time that is true is
/// while they are still looking at the form.

/// It PREPARES the SQL: parsed and planned by the engine, never executed, nothing stored. That is

/// what is acceptable would be worse than one.
///
/// It is best-effort by construction. The adapter has to be running on THIS node to answer, and
/// for a relational source it is (a pool is held per node), but a source that is stopped, broken
/// or still starting cannot be asked. In that case the save proceeds unchecked rather than being
/// blocked by an unrelated fault — refusing to let someone fix a statement because the connection
/// they are fixing it for is down would be exactly backwards.
