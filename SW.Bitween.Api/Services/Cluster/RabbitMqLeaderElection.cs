/// Leader election over the internal RabbitMQ, using the one primitive it already gives us:
/// an EXCLUSIVE QUEUE IS TIED TO A SINGLE CONNECTION. Declaring it succeeds for exactly one node
/// and fails for every other, and the broker releases it the moment that connection goes — which
/// is liveness for free, with no lease renewal to get wrong and no clock to trust.
///
/// The database supplies what the broker cannot: a monotonic term. See <see cref="IResourceLease.Term"/>.
///
/// The connection here is DEDICATED and separate from SW.Bus's. Sharing it would tie every lease
/// in the process to the same fate as ordinary message traffic — one connection blip would drop
/// every broker connection this node owns, all at once.
